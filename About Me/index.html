                <h3>Newport, RI</h3>
                <p>Newport is where I currently live and one bridge away from the island I grew up on. It's located in southern Rhode Island on Narragansett Bay and is a great place to spend the summer (I'm also here in the winter, but it's not so nice). </p>

    <h2>Data Background</h2>
    <div class="bio-section">
            <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>My undergrad degree is in Mathematics, although I actually spent most of my time lying to myself that Mechanical Engineering was the right major. I went to UVM (aka Groovy UV) in Burlington, VT.</p>
            <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>I have spent the last 2.5 years working as a Data Scientist for Virgin Pulse, a wellness technology company. My work focused on advanced reporting, visualizations, and some modelling.</p>

    <h2>Goals for the Program</h2>
    <div class="bio-section">    
            <h3>Improve Visual Coding Skills</h3>
                <p>While I have some experience creating visuals using R and some exposure to D3, I am excited to improve those skills to be able to create more engaging and interactive visuals</p>
            <h3>Storytelling</h3>
                <p>I really like the idea of using visualizations in a way to effectively communicate complex analyses to the general public. I think, that when used properly, data visualization can help educate people no matter what level of training they have with data and analysis.</p>
            <h3>Use Visuals for Good</h3>
                <p>I've recently decided to work towards focusing professionally on causes I care about. Currently, the most important cause for me is the environment and fighting Climate Change.</p>

            <h3>Sailing</h3>
                <p>I have been sailing my whole life and competed at a varisty level while at the University of Vermont. Sailing is the best summer activity, though drinking a beer by the ocean is a close second.</p>

            <h3>Skiing</h3>
                <p>I started skiing when I was 3 years old. It's one of my favorite sports and I love sending it to northern New England and New Mexico every year to shred the gnar.</p>
