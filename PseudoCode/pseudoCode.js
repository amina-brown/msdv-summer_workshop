//How to rig your kite while kite boarding

//need array with wind speed, wind direction, kiteable wind range, number of kites

//divide kiteable range by the number of kites to assign which kite for which wind speed
//decide kite size based on wind speed (more wind = smaller kite)
//use if else conditional statement
//console.log(proper kite size) 

//unpack the kite from the bag

//face the leading edge into the wind (reason for wind direction variable), inflate the kite
//console.log(direction you should face) 

//flip the kite over (keep leading edge into the wind)

//unfurl kite lines, stretch lines and bar out perpindicular to the wind
//need conditional to specify direction that is 90 degrees from the wind direction
//console.log(perpindicular direction) 

//untangle lines and attach to the kite (make sure colors match)
//use conditional statement for colors
//console.log(either "rigged correctly" or "lines are crossed") 

//put on harness

//attach harness to the bar (via chicken loop and leash)

//Sample Output:
//Based on the wind speed of X, use the Y meter kite.
//Unpacked
//Face the leading edge towards Z direction
//Inflated
//Kite flipped
//Unfurl lines towards Z+90 deg direction
//Colors match. Kite is rigged correctly.
//Harness on
//Chicken loop and leash attached
